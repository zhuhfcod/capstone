### Content
Data: In this folder, you can get the dataset required by the project, the data set includes news headlines, news body, pictures and news labels
Notebook: This folder contains the code of the project. All the data preprocessing in this project (including image enhancement, delete stop words, etc.) are included in the code file.
1. CNN_image_only_model.ipynb: Using CNN model to realize image-only classification
2. bert_text.ipynb: Using BERT model and main text feature to realize news classification
3. bert_title.ipynb: Using BERT model and title feature to realize news classification
4. Multimodal.ipynb: using multimodal neural networks to realize news classification
Image: This folder contains images from reports and blogs, including model structure and results

### Environment

It is recommended to accomplish the code on google colab, because the code may report errors locally due to version and hardware reasons

### Problem statement
